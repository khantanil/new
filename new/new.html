                    <font size="5" > <font color="blue" face="Monotype Corsiva"> Tendulkar </font> was the most complete batter of his time, the most prolific run-maker of all
                        tie,
                        and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. <br> <br>

                        His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision
                        in
                        stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to genius batters - anticipation. If he
                        didn't
                        have a signature stroke<b> (though the upright, back-foot punch comes close)</b> it was because he was
                        proficient at so many and could pull them out at will. <br> <br>

                        There were no apparent weaknesses in<font color="blue" face="Monotype Corsiva"> Tendulkar's </font> game. He could score all around the wicket, off
                        both feet, could temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the
                        world,
                        in all conditions. <br> <br>

                        Some of his finest performances came against <font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b><u>Australia</u></b></font>, the dominant team of his era. His
                        century as
                        a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever
                        to
                        have been played in that country. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the
                        ultimate batter:  <font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b>Don  Bradman </b></font>confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself. <br> <br>

                        Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and driven by a loathing for defeat, Tendulkar
                        established his greatness early. He was only 16 when he made his Test debut, and was hit in the
                        face
                        by Waqar Younis in that game, but continued to bat. <font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b>His first Test hundred, a match-saving one
                        at
                            Old Trafford, came when he was 17, </b></font>  and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he
                        became the first batter to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara
                        as
                        the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs, 30,000
                        international runs, and 50 Test hundreds. <br> <br>

                        <u>He holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs</u>- remarkable, considering he didn't
                        score his first ODI hundred until his 79th match. At just under 37 years of age, he made the
                        first
                        double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, a month short of his 39th birthday, he became the
                        first
                        player to score 100 international centuries, which, like Bradman's batting average, might be a
                        mark
                        that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a
                        disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And <font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b>on November 16, 2013, he retired from Test
                            cricket after a memorable 200th Test, against West Indies.</b> </font> <br> <br>

                        Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the
                        burden of expectation he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who
                        were prone to regarding anything less than a hundred in every innings as a failure. He still
                        remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world. <br> <br>
                    
                       He is sometimes referred to as <font color="green"><u><b>"The God of Cricket"</b></u> </font>  in India</font>
