                <p>Vikram Vedha is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language neo-noir action thriller film written-directed by
                    Pushkar–Gayathri, based on their 2017 Tamil film of the same name and also inspired by the Indian
                    folktale Baital Pachisi. The film is jointly produced by YNOT Studios, Jio Studios, Theme Studios,
                    T-Series Films, Friday Filmworks, and Reliance Entertainment. It stars Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik
                    Roshan in title roles with Radhika Apte, Rohit Saraf and Yogita Bihani in supporting roles. It tells
                    the story of an honest police officer who sets out to track down and kill a dreaded gangster. SSP
                    Vikram is an honest police officer, who has a black-and-white sense of good and evil. Vedha is a
                    dreaded gangster from Kanpur who understands the nuance in between. Vikram's best friend SSP Abbas
                    leads an encounter unit in the STF, which is formed to eliminate Vedha. In one encounter, the squad
                    kills some of Vedha's henchmen, framing an unarmed criminal killed by Vikram to avoid further
                    inquiry. As the unit plans another encounter, Vedha enters the police station and voluntarily
                    surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to narrate a story to him. The first act
                    relates about Vedha becoming a dreaded gangster, who warns his younger brother Shatak, who is a
                    mathematical genius, to stay away from crime, but Shatak is forced by a rival gangster, Babloo to
                    carry drugs. When Shatak and his friend Chanda are caught by the police, Shatak confesses and Babloo
                    is arrested. </p>

                    sequences, cinematography, direction, and songs but criticised the runtime, narration,
                    climax and
                    editing. The film is commercially successful, grossing ₹355–₹365 crore at the

                <p>RRR is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S.
                    Rajamouli, who wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V.
                    Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay
                    Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and
                    Olivia Morris. It centers around two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Alluri
                    Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), and their fight against the
                    British Raj. Set in the 1920s, the plot explores the undocumented period in their
                    lives when both the revolutionaries chose to go into obscurity before they began the
                    fight for their country.

                    Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected
                    the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and
                    been friends. The film was formally announced in March 2018. Principal photography
                    of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad which continued until August 2021,
                    owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot extensively
                    across India, with a few sequences in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack
                    and background score is composed by M. M. Keeravani with cinematography by K. K.
                    Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production
                    designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.

                    Made on a budget of ₹550 crore ($72 million).

                <p>Ponniyin Selvan: I (transl. The Son of Ponni) is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language epic historical action
                    drama film directed by Mani Ratnam, who co-wrote it with Elango Kumaravel and B. Jeyamohan. Produced
                    by Ratnam and Subaskaran Allirajah under Madras Talkies and Lyca Productions, it is the first of two
                    cinematic parts based on Kalki Krishnamurthy's 1955 novel, Ponniyin Selvan. The film stars an
                    ensemble cast including Vikram, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Jayam Ravi, Karthi, Trisha, Jayaram,
                    Aishwarya Lekshmi, Sobhita Dhulipala, Prabhu, R. Sarathkumar, Vikram Prabhu, Prakash Raj, Rahman, R.
                    Parthiban and Lal.[4] The music was composed by A. R. Rahman, with cinematography by Ravi Varman,
                    editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, and production design by Thota Tharani. Ponniyin Selvan: I dramatizes
                    the early life of Chola prince Arulmozhi Varman, who would become the renowned emperor Rajaraja I
                    (947–1014).[5]

                    Ever since its publication, a film adaptation of Ponniyin Selvan had been explored by several Tamil
                    filmmakers, including an attempt by M. G. Ramachandran in the late 1950s; however, it never
                    materialized due to financial constraints. Decades later, Ratnam attempted to adapt the novel in the
                    late-1980s and early-2010s but was unsuccessful. Calling it his "dream project", Ratnam revived the
                    effort in January 2019, after Lyca agreed to fund the film. Following several changes in cast and
                    crew, production of Ponniyin Selvan began in December 2019.
